# Desree_Riba_ExploreAI_IntegratedProject
Integrated Project. AKA, Have you learnt something? I have 


This project was fun to do because I got to prove to my family that my profession really can be applied anywhere. Coming from a rural area, Data Science doesn't form part of the career paths people talk about when talking about careers. One of the reasons why is that they don't really understand the world of data and what it means. Talk about being in a bubble. It's nice. I was there once. Until I went to university.

I hope this somewhat sheds a light, becasue not only am I going to share this with the person I did the project with, but this will be the first of many- working with small businessess in rural areas.

I decided to keep it simple because we have to start small, just like these businessess. Humbe beginnings have made many and this is one.

Go through it if you must. Give me ideas if you have.
